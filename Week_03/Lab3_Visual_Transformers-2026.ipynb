From that perspecrtive we want to create a model that can generate or continue our sequence. Specifically **statistical models** stands behind modern complex large language models and idea of generating sequences of different length.

An input sequence is a series of data points vectorized into **embeddings**, or numerical representations, that the machine learning algorithm can use to calculate attention scores needed to produce an output sequence. The embeddings are used to calculate the attention weights that help the model prioritize (or attend to) the most relevant input data.\n",
